## ðŸ“– How to Use
See the [Howto.md](./Howto.md) for detailed usage instructions.

---

## Overview

StructoPyre is a next-generation, accessible fire simulation web application designed to analyze the structural integrity of concrete buildings and evacuation dynamics during fire scenarios. The app leverages the ACI 216.1-14(19) standard to provide real-time, visual feedback on fire resistance and safety, making advanced fire engineering tools available to a broader audience.

## Background

Traditional fire simulation and structural analysis software are often expensive, complex, and inaccessible to many users. StructoPyre addresses these issues by providing a web-based, user-friendly, and standards-compliant simulation tool, focusing on:

- **Structural fire resistance** (per ACI 216.1-14(19))
- **Evacuation dynamics** in fire scenarios
- **Accessibility** for both professionals and non-experts

---

## Features

- **Import 3D Models:** Supports `.obj` (and `.mtl`) file import for building geometry.
- **Automatic & Manual Scaling:** Intelligent unit detection and manual override for model scaling.
- **Material Mapping:** Map imported materials to real-world ACI aggregate types and assign structural properties.
- **Simulation Engine:** Visualizes fire progression and checks structural elements against ACI fire-resistance requirements in real time.
- **Evacuation Dynamics:** Simulate and visualize occupant movement and egress during fire events.
- **First-Person Exploration:** Navigate imported models in first-person view.
- **Visual Feedback:** Elements change color (e.g., green = safe, red = failed) based on compliance with ACI requirements as the simulation progresses.
- **Cross-Platform:** Runs in modern browsers (WebGL) and as a standalone app.

---

## Delimitations

- Focused on **concrete structures** (no steel, timber, or composite).
- Adheres to **ACI 216.1-14(19)** provisions only.
- Does **not** perform advanced structural analysis beyond fire resistance and evacuation.
- Simulation parameters are restricted to those defined in the ACI standard.
- Real-world variables (e.g., wind, smoke, human behavior) are not modeled in detail.

---

## How It Works

1. **Import Model:** Upload your buildingâ€™s `.obj` file (optionally with `.mtl`).
2. **Assign Properties:** Use the UI to map model parts to ACI element types (slab, beam, wall, column), aggregate types, and input required properties (cover, thickness, restraint, etc.).
3. **Start Simulation:** Place fire sources and run the simulation.
4. **Real-Time Analysis:** The app checks each elementâ€™s fire resistance against ACI tables/formulas for the current simulation time.
5. **Visualize Results:** Elements that fail ACI requirements are highlighted, and evacuation routes are dynamically updated.
